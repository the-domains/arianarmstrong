I'm Arian Armstrong -- artist, wife, mom to four little boys, and daughter of The King. We live across the river from Cincinnati, OH in a 116-year-old house with an inappropriate amount of outdated wallpaper. I love drawing (so much), muh boyz, coffee shops, dark chocolate (because girl), and all things beautiful. I dislike conflict, neon colors, and wallpaper.
